SECTION 1 - INITIAL PROMPT:
  I need to create a command-line task manager programme in Python for my programming course. The programme should allow users to add, list, and remove tasks stored in memory.
    Please provide pseudocode that only uses basic Python concepts suitable for my university introductory course in business programming- no advanced features. Follow a structured planning approach with clear steps.
AI RESPONSE:
PROBLEM RESTATEMENT:
      Create a simple command-line task manager program using Python. The program should allow a user to add tasks, list existing tasks, and remove tasks. All tasks are stored in memory (using a list), and the program should continue running until the user chooses to exit. This program must use only basic Python programming concepts suitable for an introductory course.
    INPUTS:
      - User's menu choice
      - Task description
      - Task number
    OUTPUTS:
      - Menu displayed each time
      - Confirmation messages
      - List of tasks
      - Error messages for invalid input or actions

    EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
    Program displays menu:
      1. Add task
      2. List tasks
      3. Remove task
      4. Exit
    User input: 1
    User enters task: "Finish homework"
    Program response: "Task added!"
    User input: 2
    Program response:
      Tasks:
      1. Finish homework
    User input: 3
    User enters task number to remove: 1
    Program response: "Task removed!"
    User input: 4
    Program response: "Goodbye!"
    Program ends

    PSEUDOCODE:
      Initialize an empty list called tasks

Loop forever:
    Display menu:
        1. Add task
        2. List tasks
        3. Remove task
        4. Exit
    Ask user to enter their choice

    If choice is 1:
        Ask user to type a task
        Add the task to the tasks list
        Print "Task added!"

    Else if choice is 2:
        If tasks list is empty:
            Print "No tasks to display"
        Else:
            Print all tasks with numbers starting from 1

    Else if choice is 3:
        If tasks list is empty:
            Print "No tasks to remove"
        Else:
            Show the numbered task list
            Ask user for the number of the task to remove
            If number is valid:
                Remove the task from the list
                Print "Task removed!"
            Else:
                Print "Invalid task number"

    Else if choice is 4:
        Print "Goodbye!"
        Exit loop

    Else:
        Print "Invalid choice. Please try again."


    MAIN PROGRAMME:
     SET tasks TO empty list

LOOP forever
    DISPLAY menu options to user
    GET choice from user

    IF choice = 1 THEN
        GET task_description from user
        APPEND task_description TO tasks
        DISPLAY "Task added!"

    ELSE IF choice = 2 THEN
        IF tasks is empty THEN
            DISPLAY "No tasks to display"
        ELSE
            FOR each task in tasks WITH index starting from 1
                DISPLAY index and task

    ELSE IF choice = 3 THEN
        IF tasks is empty THEN
            DISPLAY "No tasks to remove"
        ELSE
            DISPLAY tasks with numbers
            GET task_number from user
            IF task_number is valid THEN
                REMOVE task at task_number - 1 FROM tasks
                DISPLAY "Task removed!"
            ELSE
                DISPLAY "Invalid task number"

    ELSE IF choice = 4 THEN
        DISPLAY "Goodbye!"
        BREAK out of loop

    ELSE
        DISPLAY "Invalid choice. Please try again."

SECTION 1 - FIRST REFINEMENT:
  Please refine the pseudocode to handle user input errors. Add specific error handling messages when letters are inputted instead of numbers and when a number outside of the menu options is inputted.

SECTION 1 - SECOND REFINEMENT:
  Can you please refine the task manager pseudocode you previously provided to include the following improvements? 1.Trim whitespace and validate task input — Make sure users can't add empty or blank tasks, and strip leading/trailing spaces from the input.
  2.Confirm task removal before deleting — After the user selects a task to remove, ask for confirmation (e.g. "Are you sure? yes/no") before deleting it.
  Please keep the solution at a beginner level suitable for an introductory programming course, using only basic Python concepts.

SECTION 2 - ERROR ANALYSIS:
  Please analyse this chatbot code for a beginner programming student. Identify errors that a student would typically make, focusing on variable names, basic logic flow, and simple programming mistakes.
AI RESPONSE:
   Comparing input to numbers without converting

input() gives a text (string), but the code checks if choice == 1 (a number). This will never be true.

Fix: Either convert choice to a number first or compare with "1" (a string).

Not calling the isdigit() method correctly

The code uses task_number.isdigit without parentheses. It should be task_number.isdigit() to check if the input is a number.

Wrong loop range when listing tasks

The loop for i in range(1, len(tasks)) skips the first task and doesn’t show all tasks.

Fix: Use for i in range(len(tasks)) to include all tasks starting from the first.

Deleting the wrong task due to off-by-one error

The user sees tasks numbered from 1, but Python lists start at 0. Deleting tasks[task_number] deletes the wrong item.

Fix: Use del tasks[task_number - 1].

Wrong check for valid task number

The code checks if task_number < 0, but task numbers start at 1.

Fix: Check if task_number < 1.

Not removing spaces from task description properly

task_description.strip() does not change the text unless assigned back.

Fix: Use task_description = task_description.strip().

No check before converting input to number

If the user types letters instead of a number, the program may crash.

Fix: Always check if input is a number with isdigit() before converting.
