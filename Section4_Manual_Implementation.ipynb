        "    In **Week 1**, I used the 6-step problem-solving process, and in Week 4, I used modular design and human planning to arrange the assignment. AI helped with grammar and formatting, including the **Week 9** doctests, while I established the logic and flow. While AI supported accuracy and efficiency, this well-rounded approach allowed me to concentrate on implementing ideas like loops/lists (**Week 5**) and input handling (**Week 2**).\n",

        "    In order to avoid crashes due to unexpected input, I used the \"Error Handling Mindset\" from **Week 6: Python Dictionaries â€“ Smart Data Structures** while determining whether the user's menu input was a legitimate integer.  Using a technique from **Week 7: Business Data Processing** called \"Defensive Programming,\" I sought confirmation before eliminating a task.  By guaranteeing consistent, secure program behavior throughout input-based tests, these strategies helped my testing (related to **Week 9: Doctest Standards**) go more smoothly.\n",
        "3. Learning Transfer\n",
        "    Like I did with the Weatherwise app in Assignment Two, I will use the iterative refinement process to regularly test and improve my final solution depending on user input and error management.  In particular, I intend to improve the decision-making logic by applying more understandable if-elif-else structures that I acquired in **Week 3: Weather Forecaster with Python Logic**. Through iterative improvements, I hope to make the application more reliable and intuitive."
