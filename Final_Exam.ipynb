        "  By gradually implementing fundamental ideas from several weeks of the training, my prompt changed.  I started by adhering to the guidelines from Week 2: customising data, gathering user input, and storing and managing tasks via variables.  This was in line with employing simple logic to create interactive, user-driven programs.\n",
        " I refined the way the software reacts to various inputs by incorporating Week 3's decision-making structures (if, elif, and else) into the pseudocode as it developed. This allowed the user to make selections through a text-based menu.  Using the abilities from Week 5: Lists & Loops, handling tasks as a collection allowed for dynamic storage, task management, and iteration.\n",

By adding simple interaction tests, task removal confirmation improved usability.\n",
