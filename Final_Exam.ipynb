        "  By gradually implementing fundamental ideas from several weeks of the training, my prompt changed.  I started by adhering to the guidelines from Week 2: customising data, gathering user input, and storing and managing tasks via variables.  This was in line with employing simple logic to create interactive, user-driven programs.\n",
        " I refined the way the software reacts to various inputs by incorporating Week 3's decision-making structures (if, elif, and else) into the pseudocode as it developed. This allowed the user to make selections through a text-based menu.  Using the abilities from Week 5: Lists & Loops, handling tasks as a collection allowed for dynamic storage, task management, and iteration.\n",
        " In order to ensure clear, user-friendly inputs and avoid crashes, the most recent improvements—removing whitespace and validating inputs—drew on the error-handling logic covered in Week 7: Business Data Processing.  By adding simple interaction tests, task removal confirmation improved usability.\n",

I used this reasoning flow to determine why the menu wasn't functioning as intended by discovering problems with the input comparison (string vs. integer).  In order to comprehend how the task list was being processed and the reasons behind the omission of some jobs, I also referred to concepts from Week 5: Lists & Loops.  I was able to think more critically about how Python manages control flow, input, and collections in practical interactions thanks to this process."
